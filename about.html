<h1>T-cell receptor (TCR)</h1>
<p>T-cell receptors are transmembrane receptors that are associated with T lymphocytes (T cells). They are expressed on the surface of T cells and are responsible for antigen recognition of peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. When the receptor binds to the antigen, it stimulates the T cell to become a cytotoxic CD8+ T cell or a helper CD4+ T cell.</p>
<h1>B-cell receptor (BCR)</h1>
<p>B-cell receptors are transmembrane receptors that are associated with B lymphocytes (B cells). They are expressed on the surface of B cells and are responsible for antigen recognition from presenter cells. When the receptor binds to the antigen, the B cell is stimulated to either become a plasma B cell or a memory B cell. </p>
<h1>TCR and BCR Loci</h1>
<p>The TCR loci is comprised of four distinct loci (TRA, TRB, TRD, and TRG), while the BCR loci is comprised of three distinct loci (IGH, IGK, and IGL).The TRA (chr 14) and TRB (chr 7) loci code for alpha and beta chains, while the TRD (chr 14) and TRG (chr 7) code for delta and gamma chains. The TRB and TRD loci consists of C (constant), D (diversity), J (joining), and V (variable) segments while the TRA and TRG loci consists of only C, J, and V segments. The IGH loci codes for the heavy chain, while the IGK and IGL loci codes for the kappa and light chains. </p>
<h1>V(D)J Recombination</h1>
<p>Variable diversity joining rearangement, known as V(D)J recombination, is a form of somatic recombination that occurs in developing lymphocytes to produce a highly diverse receptor repertoire.</p>
